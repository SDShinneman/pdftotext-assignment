Answer:

This semester, the city council set up a task force on community violence to address the wide range of factors that drive people toward violence, including systemic racism. Throughout the semester, the council also scheduled several open discussions on the issues. Members of a group called Race Matters spoke at the September 8, September 21, October 5, and November 2 meetings, and a few other community members spoke along the way. The conversations centered on creating a system of community policing rather than reactive policing. On Oct. 5, two council members voiced their support for Race Matters and said they would be doing more to educate themselves on the issues to get things going in a better direction.
